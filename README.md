# TodolistNg2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.32.3.
It is used in the NodeJS course I give at the Nomades worksho in Geneva.


# How to run

You need to install MongoDB, create a `todolist` database and a `todos` collection.

Then :

OPEN TERMINAL 1 : go inside the `/server` folder, then run `nodemon` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.

OPEN TERMINAL 2 : Run `ng build --watch` to compile the Angular 2 files.
